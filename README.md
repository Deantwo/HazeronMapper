=============

2d system mapper for Shores of Hazeron

use:
Run hazeron mapper.    
Copy a hazeron system scan from hazeron mail to clipbord (ctrl-A, ctrl-C).  
Paste (ctrl-V) into hazeronmapper (there will be no indication that this is a sucess currently)  
repeat with other scans as desired.

Click the icon below the file menu  
if pasting scans was successfull you will get a list of systems,    
select one, and increase depth to a desired amount. (at this point going above 4 is not recomended)

You should get systems placed in hazeronmapper with wormhole linklines running between them.  
drag the system icons around by grabbing the star icon  
open notes by double clicking the system name.

TODO / bugs:  
  
redo the system icon location code to fix problem with clicking the drawmap icon a second time  
  and allow zoom and moving the map around - 99% done, can move map, no zoom yet.  
  save data dialog box - done  
  open data dialog box - done  
  give the drawmap icon a picture and alt text.  
  write import mapdata code to allow merging of current loaded and another saved hzm file.  
  do something about system icons overlapping when close - improved.  
  fix horrible redraw of lines while moving systemicons around - improved.
