run hazeron mapper
copy a hazeron system scan from hazeron mail to clipbord (ctrl-A, ctrl-C).
paste (ctrl-V) into hazeronmapper (there will be no indication that this is a sucess currently)
repeat with other scans as desired.

click the icon below the file menu
if pasting scans was successfull you will get a list of systems.
select one, and increase depth to a desired amount. (at this point going above 4 is not recomended)

you should get systems placed in hazeronmapper with wormhole linklines running between them.
drag the system icons around by grabbing the star icon

TODO / bugs:

redo the system icon location code to fix problem with clicking the drawmap icon a second time
  and allow zoom and moving the map around - in progress
save data dialog box
open data dialog box
give the drawmap icon a picture and alt text.
